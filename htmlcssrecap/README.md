**// HTML && CSS Recap**
# **HTML**

  - **Doctype** element clarifies what era the code is written in (important because if it isn't clarified and the code enters a new era, i.e. HTML 5 to HTML 6, browsers will assume that the code is written in the newest version, thus your page will most likely look wayyy worse than it should!)
  - **elements** â˜ž **attributes** (names) â˜ž **value**
  - specifies what language the page is written in and then
  ```html
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  ```
  - **head** element: contains the metadata of the file
    - **meta** element: convert data into a particular set (UTF-8), **name= attribute** followed by **"description" value** and **content= attribute** and **"[what you want the little bloop that comes up in search results or links on social media]" value**
    ```HTML
    <meta name="apple-mobil-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    ```
        ###### *(Google)*
    ```html
    <meta itemprop>
    ```
    ###### *(Facebook)*
    ```HTML
      <meta property>
      ```
      - Favicons won't be animated on any other browsers besides Firefox, *but* you can animate favicons by using a series of several images/frames that load one after another very quickly to look like an animation using JavaScript
  - ***"browses are backwards compatible"***
  - "separation of concerns": splitting things (content, design, etc) up into separate modules
  - "cashing"
  - Inspect Element (vs view page source) : developer tools, use to debug websites, "artist playground" control over every website you're on, shows you the state of the your website not the algorithms that you may have written in JavaScript
  - **style** element: CSS within .html file
  - **script** element: JavaScript within .html file
