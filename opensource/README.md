#### *Copyright*
- ***Printing Press*** (c. 1440)
- Catholic Priests didn't want people to be allowed to read and write because they foresaw a revolt against the church or a breaking away from the church
- Queen Mary comes to the Stationer's Gild with a deal, if all the Protestant stuff is censored/burned(?) then the members of the Stationer's Gild are the only ones who can print, when Mary died and her sister took the throne she said let's keep the deal but not censor/burn Protestant stuff but Catholic stuff instead
- 1709 Authors enter the picture but they aren't invited into the debate, and ideas become property
- Royalists: To print material comes with great responsibility, it should remain the duty of the Monarchy ---- British Reformers & the Stationer's Gild: if anyone has rights over this material it should be the authors
- *Statute of Anne*
- America creates/plagiarizes their own copyright law to incentivize the production of American culture (ONLY AMERICAN AUTHORS WERE PROTECTED UNDER THIS)
- Founding Fathers thought that the copyright law was a bad idea, <a href= "http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/dpost/mcphersonletter.html">Jefferson</a> thought all property was theft (John Locke school)---- copyright was viewed as a compromise
- ***Why Copyright Doesn't Work***
- Cryptomnesia occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original
- only functional in capitalism

#### *Free Software Movement*
- **An Ideological Position**
- Richard Stallman (programmer and artist)
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrcdhzr2qnk">üëÅ Video üëÅ</a>
- CanLinux === Linux (the kernel) and the GNU-System
- an entire practice based on programmer/computer/internet folk art
- FLOSS === Free/Libre(/Libret√©) Open Source Software
- Non-rival risk goods vs Rival risk goods
- relating, interacting with software politically
      FOUR FREEDOMS:
      - The freedom to run the program as
      you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
      - The freedom to study how the program
      works, and change it so it does your
      computing as you wish (freedom 1).
      Access to the source code is a
      precondition for this.
      - The freedom to redistribute copies
      so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
      - The freedom to distribute copies of
      your modified versions to others
      (freedom 3). By doing this you can
      give the whole community a chance
      to benefit from your changes. Access
      to the source code is a precondition
      for this.

#### *Open Source Software*
- **An Apolitical Position (for business)**
- Contributors have created a branch with a patch that is submitted to the Maintainer and if the Maintainer accepts the patch and merges
- If the Maintainer doesn't like a branch that a contributor created, then that branch becomes a fork
- Upstream === Updating the original, in relation to Git: merging a branch into the master
- "Upstream early and often"
- Rules are called Licenses
- ***Structure, common language, and roles***
- DRM - Digital Rights Management
- relating, interacting with software practically
- "proto-opensourceness": Distribution Religion

#### *Git Review*
- Versioning control software (VCS) helps you write open-source software
- Git is a VCS (the dominant VCS)
- *repository*/**repo** === folder for all of your changes
- **commit** === save but save into the history of the timeline of my project
- **"git add ."** === adds everything within that current folder
- **"git branch [new branch name]"** === make a new branch
- **"git checkout [branch name]"** === switching branches
- **ahead** === difference in # of commits ("alt is ahead of master by 1 commit")
