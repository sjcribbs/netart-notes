low-level to high-level code
binary code
assembly code
abstract programs: C
C++, objective C
JavaScript
Python
Max MSP
Photoshop

we are looking at binary code because weâ€™re artists, meaning looking at everyday things in unconventional ways and approaching objects/concepts with new, weird perspectives
	- Get a general understanding of what technology is from the base to the interface (low to high levels, pure to abstract)

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  art historian (creates names based on culture): arabic numerals
  computer programer/mathematician: decimal or base 10

binary code
128s 64s 32s 16s 8s 4s 2s 1s
 0    0   1   0  1  0  1  1    = (in base10) 43
the largest value is 255 (11111111)

binary will stay the same, resolutions change

hexadecimal (hex)
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

bytes!
11111111 = FF = 255

First inventor/computer engineer
- used celluloid to punch holes in and a needle and mercury to create an electric current

CPU: central processing unit
- data processing (another one is GPU[graphics processing unit])
- typically when we talk about programing, we're talking about the CPU processing our programs (machine learning and cracking passcodes is GPU)
RAM
- volitial storage (doesn't save data, once off the data disappears)
Hard drive
- stores your data
- magnetic bits being flipped upside down/right-side up to represent 0 or 1

Since computers only know binary, ascii was invented to use binary to represent the symbols of that we use like the alphabet  

Interoptobility: we want computers and software and all that fun stuff to work together, so they need to agree on the same stuff

ascii -> unicode

"machine code" = raw data

raw data in files (header)
BM file
  42 4D           - BM, always start w/these two bytes
  66 00 00 00     - the file size ( in bytes )
  00 00 00 00     - special use for apps
  36 00 00 00     - how many bytes into the file does the raw data start
  28 00 00 00     - size of rest of header (in bytes)
  04 00 00 00     - width in pixels
  04 00 00 00     - height in pixels
  01 00 18 00     - color plane && bit depth (24bit)
  00 00 00 00     - compression method
  30 00 00 00     - amount of raw data (48bytes)
  00 00 00 00     -
  00 00 00 00     - misc. info

  *in atom*
  select dash then Command + D, huge cursor
  # this is header text
  ## smaller header text
  ### and a little bit smaller
  #### you get the idea...

  Command + Shift + P, search atom

  coding notes are signified within markdown by using ticks (`these guys`), then you can use three ticks and atom will color code different elements, example:
  ```html
  <a href="http://saic.edu">school</a>
  ```


  code gets written in markdown when collaborating with other coders and for posting online

markup vs markdown
xml = extensible markup language
  - can make your own markup language
  - make your own tags
  - stay consistent

other markup languages
- svg (designer, illustrator)
- mathml (mathematical notation )
